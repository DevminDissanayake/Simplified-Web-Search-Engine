# Simplified-Web-Search-Engine
1. explore a portion of the web (which weâ€™ll simulate through a database),
2. build an index of the words contained in each web page,
3. analyze the structure of the web graph to establish which web page should be ranked higher,
4. use this analysis to perform simple searches where a query word is entered by the user and a
sorted list of relevant web pages available is returned.
